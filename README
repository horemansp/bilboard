RPI based billboard/advertiser
- Image files found in the root directory of a USB drive will be displayed automatically. (jpeg, png)
- It is required to have the billboard.json file in the root directory of the USB drive. If not the USB drive will be ignored.
- Images will be resized to full screen with & height
- Display use HDMI-0 (resolution will be detected automatically)
- JSON file contains the delay between images to display. Modifying this file will change the delay.
- If the USB drive is not inserted the program will retry every 10sec to find a USB that has the billboard.json in it's root.
- At startup there is a delay of 10sec to make sure the environment is ready if you autostart the script

Instructions:
- Save billboard.json in the root folder of a USB drive or stick
- Save .jpeg and/or .png files in the root folder
- run billboard_advanced.py (or configure for autostart)




How to auto-start the script on RPI:
note:
- assume the user you auto login on RPI is pi (If another user is used then replace /pi with the /theUserName)
- assume your script is in /home/pi/billboard/code

```
mkdir /home/pi/.config/autostart
nano /home/pi/.config/autostart/billboard.desktop
```

Add the following to the file: (note: make sure to use the capitals for Desktop Entry etc!)

[Desktop Entry]
Type= Application
Name=Bilboard
Exec=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/billboard/code/billboard_advanced.py

The above won't give you any possible debug information.
You can use Xterm for troubleshooting.

sudo apt-get install xterm -y

Then modify the billboard.desktop file to the following:

[Desktop Entry]
Type= Application
Name=Bilboard
Exec=xterm -hold - e '/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/billboard/code/billboard_advanced.py'


Save and reboot
